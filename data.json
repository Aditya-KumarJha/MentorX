    "summary": "I am a serial entrepreneur with a social mission focused on making a difference in Hawaii. My current endeavour is helping people navigate through challenging life situations (i.e. career, relationships, unresolved trauma, health, etc) and gain clarity and growth. My specialty is helping leaders get \"unstuck\". I do this through business consulting, coaching and helping senior leaders find jobs in Hawaii with a special focus on Hawaii raised ex-pats looking to find a job and move home as well as Hawaii residents that want to level up their lives. \n\nI have a holistic coaching practice that combines over 30 years of cutting-edge business best practices with spiritual and therapeutic models to help \"A-level\" players that are underperforming get their mojo back. I am especially good at helping people heal from guilt, shame and grief and have a large network of solution providers as well. I also own successful ventures in food, technology and action sports. \n\nMy specialty is guiding business owners and executives in challenging situations that require someone with the experience and knowledge of the demands as a business leader with the ability to help resolve mental, spiritual and emotional issues that can't be broached with coworkers, board of directors and partners. I am the person that leaders come to when they don't know where else to go. \n\nI am constantly building and connecting people in my network when I see a win-win relationship and shared interests. I enjoy facilitating connections when it makes sense. I believe that a team effort has a big advantage over an individual effort and is more fun. \n\nMy community focus since 2005 has been to help develop more capacity for community leadership. This is done by bringing in and developing new talent. There is a shortage in Hawaii of community leaders so we have to do whatever we can to make a difference.",

We want to have open discussion around the rewards/challenges of entrepreneurship in the hopes that what you share will resonate with some of our young alumni. Ultimately, we are hoping to make a case for entrepreneurship as a life path and want to encourage everyone in attendance to reflect upon whatever path they are currently on.",
